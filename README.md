#Inventory Analysis and Optimization Project

##Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing historical sales and inventory data to optimize inventory management practices and improve working capital efficiency. The analysis covers various aspects of inventory, including demand forecasting, classification, ordering and reorder strategies, lead times, and associated costs. The goal is to provide data-driven insights and recommendations for streamlining procurement, production, and overall inventory control processes.

##Objectives
The primary objectives of this inventory analysis project were to:
Determine optimal inventory levels for products.
Identify opportunities to reduce stockouts and excess inventory.
Analyze inventory turnover and carrying costs to optimize working capital.
Streamline procurement and production processes to improve efficiency.
Tasks Performed
To achieve the project objectives, the following tasks were performed:

Demand Forecasting: Analyzed historical sales data to forecast future demand and identify trends and seasonality.
ABC Analysis: Classified inventory items based on their sales value contribution to prioritize management efforts.
Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Analysis: Calculated the optimal order quantity for products to minimize ordering and carrying costs.
Reorder Point Analysis: Determined the reorder point for each product to avoid stockouts, considering the importance of safety stock.
Lead Time Analysis: Assessed the lead time for purchases, analyzed its distribution, and identified potential influencing factors like vendors and time of year.
Carrying Cost Analysis: Estimated and analyzed the costs associated with holding inventory, including a breakdown by ABC category.
Inventory Turnover Analysis: Calculated inventory turnover ratios and days of inventory on hand to assess inventory management efficiency.


##Key Findings from the Analysis
###The analysis yielded several key findings:

Sales data shows an upward trend and significant seasonality, which impacts demand forecasting.
ABC analysis revealed that a small percentage of products contribute to a large portion of sales revenue (Category A).
Calculated EOQ and ROP provide data-driven targets for ordering and replenishment, though safety stock is crucial for mitigating variability.
Lead times vary significantly across vendors, impacting reorder points and safety stock requirements.
Carrying costs are substantial, with Category A products contributing the most. High days of inventory on hand indicate potential inefficiencies in inventory turnover.


##Recommendations and Strategy
Based on the analysis, a comprehensive inventory management strategy is recommended, focusing on:

Segmented Inventory Management: Tailoring inventory strategies (forecasting, ordering, monitoring) based on ABC classification, with a higher focus on Category A items.
Data-Driven Ordering: Integrating calculated EOQ and ROP values into procurement processes and regularly updating them.
Lead Time Optimization: Collaborating with vendors to reduce lead time and its variability.
Carrying Cost Reduction: Focusing on reducing inventory levels, especially for high-value items, and improving inventory turnover.
Improved Demand Forecasting: Continuously enhancing forecasting accuracy to better align inventory with demand.
Addressing Slow-Moving Inventory: Implementing strategies to reduce inventory levels for Category C items.
Leveraging Technology: Utilizing inventory management systems for better tracking, visibility, and automation.
Specific recommendations include implementing more precise forecasting for Category A, incorporating safety stock into ROP calculations based on variability analysis, and developing strategies to improve the turnover of slow-moving inventory. The aim is to balance costs, optimize working capital, and improve service levels.
